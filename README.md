GlobeTrotter v0.1
============

Geography Game

Thanks for trying out GlobeTrotter! You're awesome (and I mean it).
Before you get too excited to try out this awesome game, it's still in a *very* early build,
so there aren't that many places you go (as of now there are only 3), but there I'm in the
process of adding more as I type.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How to actually get the game running:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you're on a Mac or Linux, just open up your favorite terminal client and type this:
<code>java -jar /path/to/GlobeTrotter.jar</code>
You can also drag the jar file into the terminal window instead of typing out the entire
path.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
How to Play
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's pretty easy to get started, but here are some more in depth instructions if it's not 
clear just by starting the game:

1)Select 'New Game'<br>
2)Follow the command prompts on the screen.<br>
3)Choose if you want to travel somewhere new or see some sights in your starting location.<br>
4)Rinse and repeat until you run out of money or have gone everywhere in the world
