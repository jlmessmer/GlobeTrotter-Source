GlobeTrotter v0.1
============

<h2>Geography Game Source</h2>

<p>This is the source code for the game I made called <a href="https://github.com/liteblade/GlobeTrotter">GlobeTrotter</a></p>


<h3>Info</h3>

<p>This is still in a very early alpha build. I still need to add a bunch of locations people can go to
and refine the game mechanics.</p>


<h3Todo List</h3>
<ol>
<li>Add more locations (I want to get it up to 100 locations eventually).</li>
<li>Refine the game mechanics. Add better scoring for distance traveled vs attractions seen, etc</li>
<li>Eventually give the game a GUI, but that's a while down the road after I've finished the gameplay
mechanics</li>
<ol>
